# Sad Song Analyzer
I wrote this almost entirely with Claude! The purpose here was to learn what Claude could do in an environment where I knew that the basic coding tasks would be easy for it. Predictably, the writing of a local working prototype was trivial, taking about two hours. Deployment was not, taking several days (though only a little bit each day), and taught what Claude Code out of the box struggled with! And, out of the box is crucial here, no MCPs were used to help with debugging a production environment. But without clear feedback, it was hard to communicate the exact error, so it tended to go in circles. However, it was very helpful for adding logging, which it could do in nearly one shot! I'm excited to try building something more ambitious, to put Claude through its paces in an environment where it needs much more cooperation, and feel like I learned a lot about how building simple web apps might work in the AI era.
